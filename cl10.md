# 1. Importing candy data

 let’s get the data from the FiveThirtyEight GitHub repo. Either way we
need to load it up with `read.csv()`and inspect the data to see exactly
what we’re dealing with.

``` r
#set the file to candy_file when downloading the correct dataset "candy-data.csv"
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

Note: The functions `dim()`, `nrow()`, `table()` and `sum()` may be
useful for answering the first 2 questions.

-   **Q1**. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

``` r
total_candy_types <- nrow(candy)
print(total_candy_types)
```

    [1] 85

There is **85 different** candy types

-   **Q2**. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

``` r
fruity_candy_types <- sum(candy$fruity == 1)
print(fruity_candy_types)
```

    [1] 38

There is **38 fruity candy** types out of the 85 candy types

# 2. What is your favorate candy?

We can find the `winpercent` value for Twix by using its name to access
the corresponding row of the dataset.  the dataset has each candy name
as `rownames` (recall that we set this when we imported the original CSV
file). For example the code for Twix is:

``` r
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 81.64291

The winpercent value is at 81.64

-   **Q3**. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is
    it’s `winpercent` value?

``` r
candy["Almond Joy", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 50.34755

The winpercent value is at 50.34

-   **Q4**. What is the `winpercent` value for “Kit Kat”?

``` r
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 76.7686

The winpercent value is at 76.76

-   **Q5**. What is the `winpercent` value for “Tootsie Roll Snack
    Bars”?

``` r
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 49.6535

**Side-note**: the skimr::skim() function

There is a useful `skim()` function in the **skimr** package that can
help give you a quick overview of a given dataset. Let’s install this
package and try it on our candy data.

``` r
#install.packages('skimr')

# use the library function to use 'skimr' command to load the skimr package 
library("skimr")

# sue skim function to get an overview of the dataset
skim(candy)
```

**Hint**: look at the “Variable type” print out from
the `skim()` function. Most varables (i.e. columns) are on the zero to
one scale but not all. Some columns such as `chocolate` are exclusively
either zero or one values.

-   **Q6**. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different
    scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Most of the columns are binary, having values 0 or 1 to determine the
catagory as “yes” or “no”, except for the **`winpercent`**,
**`sugarpercent`** and **`pricepercent`** columns. These columns have
values on a different scale, ranging from 0 to 100 for **`winpercent`**
which demonstrates the quartiles giving the extreme value and from 0 to
1 for **`pricepercent` and `sugarpercent`**.

-   **Q7**. What do you think a zero and one represent for
    the `candy$chocolate` column?

For the **`candy$chocolate`** column, a zero represents a candy that is
not chocolate, while a one represents a chocolate candy. Since this
column has only zero and one values, it is a binary variable indicating
the presence or absence of chocolate in a candy.

A good place to start any exploratory analysis is with a histogram. You
can do this most easily with the base R function `hist()`.
Alternatively, you can use `ggplot()` with `geom_hist()`. Either works
well in this case and (as always) its your choice.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

-   **Q8**. Plot a histogram of `winpercent` values

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

we want to calculate the mean of chocolate and fruity candies

-   **Q9**. Is the distribution of `winpercent` values symmetrical?

no, they are not

-   **Q10**. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

majority of the candies are below 50% threshold, skewed to the left

-   **Q11**. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than
    fruit candy?

``` r
# use as.logical command to determine the candy$chocloate winpercent by changing the values from integer to True and False
chocolate_winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]


# use as.logical command to determine the candy$fruity winpercent by changing the values from integer to True and False
fruity_winpercent <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
```

``` r
table(as.logical(candy$chocolate))
```


    FALSE  TRUE 
       48    37 

``` r
#use mean command on chocolate_winpercent
mean(chocolate_winpercent)
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
#use mean command on fruity_winpercent
mean(fruity_winpercent)
```

    [1] 44.11974

-   **Q12**. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t_test_result <- t.test(chocolate_winpercent, fruity_winpercent)
t_test_result
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  chocolate_winpercent and fruity_winpercent
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

``` r
cat(t_test_result$p.value)
```

    2.871378e-08

using the statistical test direct by p-value test to the distribution
and not the mean to account all values. The achieved value is
0.000000028 which is extremely significant and did not occur due to
chance.

At a 95% confidence interval there is 11.4% difference in chocolate
candy when comparing the values to the distribution of fruity candy 22%.

``` r
boxplot(chocolate_winpercent, fruity_winpercent)

# 3. Overall Candy Rankings

Let’s use the base R `order()` function together with `head()` to sort
the whole dataset by `winpercent`. Or if you have been getting into the
tidyverse and the **dplyr** package you can use the `arrange()` function
together with `head()` to do the same thing and answer the following
questions:

-   **Q13**. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

``` r
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)

-   **Q15**. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based
    on `winpercent` values.

**HINT**: Use the `aes(winpercent, rownames(candy))` for your first
ggplot like so:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

-   **Q16**. This is quite ugly, use the `reorder()` function to get the
    bars sorted by `winpercent`?

``` r
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+
  geom_col()
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

### Time to add some useful color…

``` r
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

Now let’s try our barplot with these colors. Note that we
use `fill=my_cols` for `geom_col()`. Experement to see what happens if
you use `col=mycols`.

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)

Now, for the first time, using this plot we can answer questions like:  

-   **Q17**. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst chocolate is sixlets

-   **Q18**. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked flavor fruity candy is starbursts

# 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

There is a regular `geom_label()` that comes with ggplot2. To help with
this we can use the `geom_text_repel()` function from
the **ggrepel** package.

``` r
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 52)
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

**Q19**. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms
of `winpercent` for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your
buck?

``` r
ord1<- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord1,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

                              pricepercent winpercent
    Reese's Peanut Butter cup        0.651   84.18029
    Reese's Miniatures               0.279   81.86626
    Twix                             0.906   81.64291
    Kit Kat                          0.511   76.76860
    Snickers                         0.651   76.67378

**Q20**. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset
and of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord2<- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord2,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534
    Nestle Smarties                 0.976   37.88719
    Ring pop                        0.965   35.29076
    Hershey's Krackel               0.918   62.28448
    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

# 5 Exploring the correlation structure

We’ll use correlation and view the results with the **corrplot** package
to plot a correlation matrix.

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.92 loaded

``` r

-   **Q22**. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
    (i.e. have minus values)?

When examining the plot the two variables that are anti-correlated with
a -1 value is chocolate and fruity category

-   **Q23**. Similarly, what two variables are most positively
    correlated?

When examining the plot the two variables that are most positively
correlated with a 0.8 value is chocolate and bar

# 6. Principal Component Analysis

Let’s apply PCA using the `prcomp()` function to our candy dataset
remembering to set the `scale=TRUE` argument.

``` r
pca <- prcomp(candy,scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                              PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4    PC5     PC6     PC7
    Standard deviation     2.0788 1.1378 1.1092 1.07533 0.9518 0.81923 0.81530
    Proportion of Variance 0.3601 0.1079 0.1025 0.09636 0.0755 0.05593 0.05539
    Cumulative Proportion  0.3601 0.4680 0.5705 0.66688 0.7424 0.79830 0.85369
                               PC8     PC9    PC10    PC11    PC12
    Standard deviation     0.74530 0.67824 0.62349 0.43974 0.39760
    Proportion of Variance 0.04629 0.03833 0.03239 0.01611 0.01317
    Cumulative Proportion  0.89998 0.93832 0.97071 0.98683 1.00000

Now we can plot our main PCA score plot of PC1 vs PC2.

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

We can change the plotting character and add some color:

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)

We can make a much nicer plot with the **ggplot2** package. We will then
use this for making plots below

``` r
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

``` r
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)

Again we can use the **ggrepel** package and the function
`ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label up the plot with non overlapping
candy names like

``` r
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 36)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png)

you can change the `max.overlaps` value to allow more overlapping labels
or pass the ggplot object `p`to **plotly** like so to generate an
interactive plot

``` r
#install.packages("plotly") 
#library(plotly)

#ggplotly(p)
```

Do these make sense to you? Notice the opposite effects
of `chocolate` and `fruity` and the similar effects
of `chocolate` and `bar`

``` r
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

![](cl10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png)

-   **Q24**. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in
    the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The variables Fruity, Hard, and Pluribus are in the positive direction.
This principle component makes sense because all these variables are
correlated to each other for fruity type candies as opposed to the
negative direction of PC1 all the variables are related to chocolate
candy.
